# Introduction:
Welcome to the "Job Post Analysis and Report" repository! In this project, we employed data analysis methodologies using Python to analyze job posting data. Our objective was to provide valuable insights into the job market landscape and assist stakeholders in making informed decisions.

## Methodology:
Our methodology involved several key steps:

- Data Collection: We gathered datasets scraped by Data Engineering Interns, ensuring they're in a structured format.
- Data Cleaning: We performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizing Python libraries and tools, we conducted exploratory data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to different technology jobs.
- Visualization: We visualized the analysis results using appropriate charts, graphs, and visual representations to enhance understanding and interpretation.
